## Improvement proposal for DriftbotSlack

* OOP structure with sensible strategy patterns
* Independence of which type of bot (Slack, Facebook, etc.) is run, any type of bot can answer the same inquiries and has more or less the same functionality
* Adaptor to Google Calendar as to constantly show who is supposedly working right now
